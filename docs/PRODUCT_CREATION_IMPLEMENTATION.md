# Product Creation Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the product creation system for vendors in the marketplace.

## Overview

The product creation system allows vendors to:

- Create new products with basic information (name, price, stock, visibility)
- Upload multiple product images with drag-and-drop functionality
- Edit existing products
- Manage their product catalog with search and filtering
- Delete products with confirmation

## Components

### 1. ProductCreationForm (`components/vendor/ProductCreationForm.tsx`)

A comprehensive form component for creating new products with the following features:

- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all required fields
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop image upload with preview
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar during image upload and product creation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS

**Key Features:**

- Product name, price (in GHS), stock quantity, and visibility toggle
- Multiple image upload with presigned URLs
- Image preview with primary image designation
- Form validation with real-time error clearing
- Progress tracking for upload and creation process

### 2. ProductList (`components/vendor/ProductList.tsx`)

A product management interface that displays all vendor products with:

- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search by product name
- **Filtering**: Filter by visibility status (All, Visible, Hidden)
- **Product Actions**: View, edit, and delete products
- **Stock Status**: Visual indicators for stock levels
- **Responsive Table**: Mobile-friendly table layout

**Key Features:**

- Search products by name
- Filter by visibility status
- View product details with thumbnails
- Edit and delete products with confirmation
- Stock status indicators (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock)

### 3. ProductEditForm (`components/vendor/ProductEditForm.tsx`)

A form component for editing existing products with:

- **Pre-populated Data**: Loads existing product information
- **Image Management**: View current images and add new ones
- **Form Validation**: Same validation as creation form
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress during updates

**Key Features:**

- Pre-populated form fields from existing product data
- Display current product images
- Add new images to existing products
- Update product information with validation

## Pages

### 1. Product List Page (`app/vendor/products/page.tsx`)

Displays the product list using the `ProductList` component.

### 2. Product Creation Page (`app/vendor/products/create/page.tsx`)

Displays the product creation form using the `ProductCreationForm` component.

### 3. Product Edit Page (`app/vendor/products/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

Displays the product edit form using the `ProductEditForm` component.

## API Integration

The implementation uses autogenerated API hooks from the marketplace API:

### Product Management

- `usePostProducts`: Create new products
- `usePutProductsId`: Update existing products
- `useDeleteProductsId`: Delete products
- `useGetProductsId`: Get single product details
- `useGetVendorProducts`: Get vendor's product list

### Image Upload

- `usePostUploadPresignedUrl`: Get presigned URLs for S3 upload

## Data Flow

### Product Creation Flow

1. User fills out product form
2. User selects images (optional)
3. Images are uploaded to S3 using presigned URLs
4. Product data is submitted with image URLs
5. User is redirected to product list on success

### Product Update Flow

1. Existing product data is loaded
2. User modifies form fields
3. New images are uploaded (if any)
4. Updated product data is submitted
5. User is redirected to product list on success

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with real-time feedback
- **API Errors**: Proper error messages for API failures
- **Image Upload Errors**: Validation for file type, size, and upload failures
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of network issues

## Styling

The implementation uses:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and styling
- **Shadcn/ui Components**: For consistent UI components
- **Lucide React Icons**: For consistent iconography
- **Sonner**: For toast notifications

## Security

- **Authentication**: All endpoints require vendor authentication
- **Authorization**: Vendors can only manage their own products
- **File Validation**: Image files are validated for type and size
- **Presigned URLs**: Secure image upload using S3 presigned URLs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the product creation system:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk edit and delete products
2. **Product Categories**: Add category management
3. **Product Variants**: Support for product variants (size, color, etc.)
4. **SEO Fields**: Add meta title, description, and keywords
5. **Inventory Management**: Advanced stock management features
6. **Product Templates**: Save and reuse product templates
7. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and optimization
8. **Product Import/Export**: CSV import/export functionality

## Usage

### For Vendors

1. Navigate to `/vendor/products` to view product list
2. Click "Add Product" to create a new product
3. Fill out the form and upload images
4. Click "Create Product" to save
5. Use the edit and delete actions to manage products

### For Developers

1. Import components from `@/components/vendor`
2. Use the autogenerated API hooks for data operations
3. Follow the established patterns for form validation and error handling
4. Extend components as needed for additional features

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- Next.js 14+
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React icons
- Sonner (toast notifications)
- React Query (for API state management)
